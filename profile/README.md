## Hi there 👋  
We are a pioneering technology organization in the fields of **natural language processing**, **knowledge management**, and **intelligent search**.  
Our mission is to build core platforms that empower businesses and organizations to effectively and accurately harness knowledge from unstructured data.

### 🚀 Our Flagship Projects

- 🔍 **[NFlow](https://github.com/N2FlowJS/nflow)** — An intelligent document processing and knowledge management system. It leverages vector embeddings and NLP to extract, organize, and query information from various document formats.

- 🧠 **[NBase](https://github.com/N2FlowJS/nbase)** — A high-performance vector database optimized for similarity search, neural search applications, and machine learning embeddings.

Together, NFlow and NBase provide a seamless pipeline for extracting insights and conducting powerful semantic search across large-scale, unstructured datasets.
